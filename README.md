## Overview

<table>
<tr>
<td>

The purpose of this project is for you to demonstrate your knowledge acquired in the **Specialized Redux Bootcamp**.

With this E-commerce project, you will have the opportunity to show your [**React**](https://reactjs.org/docs/getting-started.html) skills by adding functionality and applying [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started), the toolset for global state management that you have learned in this Bootcamp.

Here you will find all the instructions to complete and deliver your **Redux Capstone Project**.

## Deliverables

<table>
<tr>
<td>

All deliverables are cumulative, and for each delivery:

- Use [**React Hooks**](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html) in your components.
- Use [**styled-components**](https://styled-components.com/docs) for component styles or any other _CSS_ library or framework like [**Material UI**](https://mui.com/material-ui/getting-started/overview/) or [**Bootstrap**](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/getting-started/introduction).
- Ensure that your application does not log warnings and errors in the browser console.
- Create a _pull request_ (_PR_) for each _deliverable_ to merge into your `main` **GitHub** branch.

### Third and last delivery

In this final assignment, you will fetch the [**API**](https://wizeline-academy-react-redux-api.netlify.app/) and add [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) to manage the state of your application.

Stay tuned on [**Slack**](https://wizelineacademy.slack.com/archives/C03KCQ0CPDM) because we will send you your **API key** on Friday, July 8th, 2022, so you will be allowed access to the [API](https://wizeline-academy-react-redux-api.netlify.app/).

<table>
<tr>
<td>

#### Requirements of the third deliverable

1. Create a new branch with the name `feat/deliverable3` derived from `main` on your forked repository.
1. Add [**Redux Toolkit**](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/introduction/getting-started) to your project to simplify your _store_ setup, your _reducers_, and your _update logic_.
1. On the **Products** module, instead of reading from the **mock file**, now use `createAsyncThunk` and your _API Key_ to fetch data _asynchronously_ from the `/products` endpoint of this [API](https://wizeline-academy-react-redux-api.netlify.app/).
1. Save products and quantities in the **Redux** _store_ when the user clicks on the "**Add to cart**" buttons in the **Products** module.
1. Read those products and quantities from the **Redux** _store_ and allow updates and deletes when the user interacts with the "**Quantity"** _input_ and the "**Remove"** _button_ in the **Cart** module.
1. Allow the user to click the "**Checkout**" button only if there are items in the cart, and when that happens, use `createAsyncThunk` and your _API Key_ to post an order using the `/orders` endpoint of this [API](https://wizeline-academy-react-redux-api.netlify.app/). Show the _API_ response, the error if something goes wrong, or the "**order**" and "**message"** if the post is successful.
1. Deploy your app on [**Netlify**](https://www.netlify.com/), [**Firebase**](https://firebase.google.com/products-build), [**Heroku**](https://www.heroku.com/), [**GitHub Pages**](https://pages.github.com/), or any other hosting service you prefer.
1. When you meet all _AC_ of this third deliverable, fill out this [form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSeXxiqrN2BjLTVF79xI6OdCedGgaw_6pxWOrNEoxDkEaExEWA/viewform) and add the _URL_ of your _PR_ and the _URL_ of your deployment.
